     * The base damage of an attack, modified by the strength bonus, is multiplied with the square of the Opening, to determine final damage.
     * Example: A red attack, with a total damage of 50, hits a target with 50% "Cornered" opening.
     * The target takes 50 * (0.5 * 0.5) = 12.5 points of damage. Had the target instead been 60% "Cornered",
     * it would have taken 50 * (0.6 * 0.6) = 18 points of damage.
     * <p>
     * If there are multiple openings matching the attack -- many attacks target more than one attack dimension --
     * the inverse of these are multiplied to determine the product to be squared to determine the final damage. Example:
     * A yellow and blue attack, with a total damage of 50, hits a target with 30% "Reeling", and 50% "Dizzy",
     * that is the yellow and blue openings respectively. The total amount of matching Openings are thus
     * 1 - ((1 - 0.3) * (1 - 0.5)) = 0.65,
     * and the target takes 50 * (0.65 * 0.65) = 21.125 points of damage.
     * <p>
     * For Melee we use the weapon damage and weapon quality to get full damage
     * ((Weapon Damage * sqrt(sqrt(str * weap quality)/10)) * damage weight) * openingweight
     * For UA we use just the damage from the move and str,
     * knuckles and lynx claws also help but it's not worth caring about
     * ((damage * sqrt(str/10)) * damage weight) * openingweight
     *
     * @return (Damage, Grievous Damage)

    /**
     * Spending more points on a combat effect increases the efficiency of said combat effect in that school.
     * The meaning of increasing the weight of some particular combat effect is indicated in the descriptive
     * text for that combat effect by a μ-symbol (Mu). The actual value of μ ranges from 1 to 1.5, depending
     * on your weighting. Usually, a higher weight for some particular combat effect will serve to reduce its cooldown,
     * increase its damage, or the like.
     * <p>
     * Attacks specify some percentage of openings which they add to their targets, for example 20% "Reeling".
     * If an attack says that it adds 20% "Reeling", that means that it will add 20% of whatever is left until the target has an opening of 100%.
     * For example: If a target is already 40% Reeling, and is hit by an attack which adds 20% Reeling, the attack will add (1 - 0.4) * 0.2 = 0.12 = 12%,
     * and thus bring the target up to 52% Reeling. This, of course, then modified by the Attack and Block weight comparison between the player's respective
     * combat values, which still works as it always has.
     * <p>
     * How does enemy blocking weight factor into this compared to our attack weight?
     * sqrt(block weight/attack weight)
     * <p>
     * So:
     * def -> def + (((1 - def_{old}) * opening * sqrt(sqrt((attackweight * Mu)/blockweight))))
