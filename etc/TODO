TODO
    - Marker list, can't scroll out of range of current selected item
    - auto toggle tracking on login and crim acts, put these are options under Gameplay
    - Loftar map
        - Auto add icons for: village idol, minehole, minehole ladders,
        - follow camera + offset (akin to minimap)
        - Switch cache location for this client in short run. APPDATA -> <base folder>/data/cache
        - Switch to sqlite for storage, not dynamic. It's own map.sqlite to keep it separate.
    - Party
        - Party members send grid id, offset every x seconds to override loftar's stuff? - Make this an option
    - Ability to make waypoints that you don't automatically go to, but can at a later date
    - Follow movement should point a pointer on the gob you're chasing - Make this an option
    - Need to polish queued movement. Some things cancel it that shouldn't.. can't rely on old tricks
    - Always on fight deck hotbar?
    - Fix up Water tiles. The skybox under them is ugly and doesn't fit with the rest of the game.
        - The top transparent layer has weird oddities with it
        - Realistically the water color itself should be at the level where the transparent part is rather than lowered
        - The water surface floor can be at the correct depth
        - Also it ignores global lighting and is always lit
    - Ability to draw on Loftar's map ?
        - Share with party for planning, attacks, etc
    - Search all open inventories based off name, isFood, isEquipment, etc, etc
    - Movable Fightsess (split into two parts maybe?)
    - Fightsess move icons clickable
    - Grid View + tooltips = non-bold lines. Something from tooltips must be causing an extra GL command to fuck over lines
    - UI

    - Smart Aim
    - Scripting
        - Proximity aggroing with keybind or menugrid shortcut (SCRIPT)
