TODO
    - Pathfinding
        - continuous updating for long distance clicks.
            - If it founds out it needs to update its path it can do adjust as needed based off new path
        - Adaptive pathfinding tier
            - Right now it's fixed tiers where the pathing is perfect or "fastest". To speed things up even further
            it should be able to start at "fastest" and adapt on the fly as to if it needs to be more perfect or not
            That way in tight spaces it'll use the perfect pathing while in long straights it can do the fastest pathing
    - Fix GLSettings
    - Move away from GL 1.x calls for UI
    - Marker list, can't scroll out of range of current selected item
    - Loftar map
        - follow camera + offset (akin to minimap)
        - Switch to sqlite for storage, not dynamic. It's own map.sqlite to keep it separate.
    - Party
        - Party members send grid id, offset every x seconds to override loftar's stuff? - Make this an option
    - Ability to make waypoints that you don't automatically go to, but can at a later date
    - Follow movement should point a pointer on the gob you're chasing - Make this an option
    - Need to polish queued movement. Some things cancel it that shouldn't.. can't rely on old tricks
    - Always on fight deck hotbar?
    - Ability to draw on Loftar's map ?
        - Share with party for planning, attacks, etc
    - Search all open inventories based off name, isFood, isEquipment, etc, etc
    - Movable Fightsess (split into two parts maybe?)
    - Fightsess move icons clickable
    - Grid View + tooltips = non-bold lines. Something from tooltips must be causing an extra GL command to fuck over lines
    - Smart Aim
    - Scripting
    - Inventories
        - Transfer all of one kind (Shift + Right click), being lock aware
    - Allow targetting of objs and the TargetSprite
    - Queued movement
        - Show path for this
    - Alt + Right Click ground (Low Priority)
        - Add Gob
        - Edit tile
    - Alt + Right Click Obj FlowerMenu
        - Edit Gob (Low Priority)
    - Graphics
        - Low priority
            - More FlavObjs ("more-flavobjs" -> False);
            - Skybox + Skybox range ("show-skybox" -> False, "skybox-range" -> ???)
            - Don't delete grids ("dont-delete-grids" -> False)
                - Map Grid radius for drawing, default: 2 ("map-draw-radius" -> 2)
    - Enable profiling -> Show profiling windows via Options under "UI"
    - UI scaling
