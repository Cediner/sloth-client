TODO
    - Always on fight deck hotbar
    - Options grouping to make it more readable...
    - Alt + Right click map tile -> "Mark for party", Same idea as Gob but for a specific map tile
        - Will need to be sent { GridID, OffsetInGrid } since GC are not the same for everyone?
    - Clicking on Loftar map -> moving to that location
    - Right click Loftar map -> make Pointer of the location you want to go to
        - Both of these can be done only on the same map you're gob is on.  Find offset between location and plgob on
          the Loftar map. Compare real rc -> loftar rc and tranform offset to real rc
    - Fix up Water tiles. The skybox under them is ugly and doesn't fit with the rest of the game.
        - The top transparent layer has weird oddities with it
        - Realistically the water color itself should be at the level where the transparent part is rather than lowered
        - The water surface floor can be at the correct depth
        - Also it ignores global lighting and is always lit
    - Search all open inventories based off name, isFood, isEquipment, etc, etc
    - Movable Fightsess (split into two parts maybe?)
    - Fightsess move icons clickable
    - Grid View + tooltips = non-bold lines. Something from tooltips must be causing an extra GL command to fuck over lines
    - Infinite zoom out on Overview map
        - This has more to do with merging the overview map with the minimap -> probably won't happen
    - UI
        - Keybinds
        - Separate Study Window
    - Smart Aim
    - Scripting
        - Proximity aggroing with keybind or menugrid shortcut (SCRIPT)
            - click button -> aggro everything within 10 tiles? 5 tiles? customizable!
                - Works on Humans (unknown or RED) and Animals
    - Inventories
        - Drop all of one kind (Shift + Ctrl + Right Click), being lock aware
        - Transfer all of one kind (Shift + Right click), being lock aware
        - Right click to equip
    - Fix "Show Animations" to actually stop animations
    - Allow targetting of objs and the TargetSprite
    - Queued movement
        - Show path for this
    - Alt + Right Click ground (Low Priority)
        - Add Gob
        - Edit tile
    - Alt + Right Click Obj FlowerMenu
        - Edit Gob (Low Priority)
    - Graphics
        - Low priority
            - More FlavObjs ("more-flavobjs" -> False);
            - Skybox + Skybox range ("show-skybox" -> False, "skybox-range" -> ???)
            - Don't delete grids ("dont-delete-grids" -> False)
                - Map Grid radius for drawing, default: 2 ("map-draw-radius" -> 2)
    - Enable profiling -> Show profiling windows via Options under "UI"
