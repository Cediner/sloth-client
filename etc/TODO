TODO
    - Ard
        - Aggro players in proximity to the mouse cursor
        - Aggro animals in proximity to the mouse cursor
    - Add more keybinds for switching through hotbar pages
        - Ie: Alt+1 = page 1 of number bar, Alt+2 = page 2, etc
    - Move away from GL 1.x calls for UI
    - Marker list, can't scroll out of range of current selected item
    - Loftar map
        - follow camera + offset (akin to minimap)
        - Switch to sqlite for storage, not dynamic. It's own map.sqlite to keep it separate.
    - Party
        - Party members send grid id, offset every x seconds to override loftar's stuff? - Make this an option
    - Ability to make waypoints that you don't automatically go to, but can at a later date
    - Follow movement should point a pointer on the gob you're chasing - Make this an option
    - Need to polish queued movement. Some things cancel it that shouldn't.. can't rely on old tricks
    - Always on fight deck hotbar?
    - Fix up Water tiles. The skybox under them is ugly and doesn't fit with the rest of the game.
        - The top transparent layer has weird oddities with it
        - Realistically the water color itself should be at the level where the transparent part is rather than lowered
        - The water surface floor can be at the correct depth
        - Also it ignores global lighting and is always lit
    - Ability to draw on Loftar's map ?
        - Share with party for planning, attacks, etc
    - Search all open inventories based off name, isFood, isEquipment, etc, etc
    - Movable Fightsess (split into two parts maybe?)
    - Fightsess move icons clickable
    - Grid View + tooltips = non-bold lines. Something from tooltips must be causing an extra GL command to fuck over lines
    - Smart Aim
    - Scripting
        - Proximity aggroing with keybind or menugrid shortcut (SCRIPT)
            - click button -> aggro everything within 10 tiles? 5 tiles? customizable!
                - Works on Humans (unknown or RED) and Animals
    - Inventories
        - Drop all of one kind (Shift + Ctrl + Right Click), being lock aware
        - Transfer all of one kind (Shift + Right click), being lock aware
        - Right click to equip
    - Fix "Show Animations" to actually stop animations
    - Allow targetting of objs and the TargetSprite
    - Queued movement
        - Show path for this
    - Alt + Right Click ground (Low Priority)
        - Add Gob
        - Edit tile
    - Alt + Right Click Obj FlowerMenu
        - Edit Gob (Low Priority)
    - Graphics
        - Low priority
            - More FlavObjs ("more-flavobjs" -> False);
            - Skybox + Skybox range ("show-skybox" -> False, "skybox-range" -> ???)
            - Don't delete grids ("dont-delete-grids" -> False)
                - Map Grid radius for drawing, default: 2 ("map-draw-radius" -> 2)
    - Enable profiling -> Show profiling windows via Options under "UI"
    - UI scaling
