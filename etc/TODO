TODO
    - Pause prevents MapView.setup() -> prevents very important things from happening in weird situations -> Leaks gobs for example
    - Customize icons for scripts like Ape
    - fix some of the color changes not updating -> ex: hidden, path cols.. they aren't indir
    - Pathfinding
        - continuous updating for long distance clicks.
            - If it founds out it needs to update its path it can do adjust as needed based off new path
    - Fix GLSettings
    - Move away from GL 1.x calls for UI
    - Marker list, can't scroll out of range of current selected item
    - Loftar map
        - follow camera + offset (akin to minimap)
        - Switch to sqlite for storage, not dynamic. It's own map.sqlite to keep it separate.
    - Party
        - Party members send grid id, offset every x seconds to override loftar's stuff? - Make this an option
    - Ability to make waypoints that you don't automatically go to, but can at a later date
    - Follow movement should point a pointer on the gob you're chasing - Make this an option
    - Need to polish queued movement. Some things cancel it that shouldn't.. can't rely on old tricks
    - Always on fight deck hotbar?
    - Ability to draw on Loftar's map ?
        - Share with party for planning, attacks, etc
    - Search all open inventories based off name, isFood, isEquipment, etc, etc
    - Movable Fightsess (split into two parts maybe?)
    - Fightsess move icons clickable
    - Grid View + tooltips = non-bold lines. Something from tooltips must be causing an extra GL command to fuck over lines
    - Smart Aim
    - Scripting
    - Inventories
        - Transfer all of one kind (Shift + Right click), being lock aware
    - Allow targetting of objs and the TargetSprite
    - Queued movement
        - Show path for this
    - Alt + Right Click ground (Low Priority)
        - Add Gob
        - Edit tile
    - Alt + Right Click Obj FlowerMenu
        - Edit Gob (Low Priority)
    - Graphics
        - Low priority
            - More FlavObjs ("more-flavobjs" -> False);
            - Skybox + Skybox range ("show-skybox" -> False, "skybox-range" -> ???)
            - Don't delete grids ("dont-delete-grids" -> False)
                - Map Grid radius for drawing, default: 2 ("map-draw-radius" -> 2)
    - Enable profiling -> Show profiling windows via Options under "UI"
    - UI scaling
